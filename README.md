## 🎮 About

**PyKuma** (Python + Akuma) is a faithful recreation of **Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike**, built from scratch in Python to demonstrate professional game engine architecture and fighting game mechanics. It showcases:

- **60 FPS frame-perfect gameplay** with professional input buffering
- **State machine architecture** for character behavior management
- **Frame-accurate collision detection** with hitbox/hurtbox systems
- **YAML-driven animation system** for data-driven game design
- **Complete fighting game systems**: hitstop, hitstun, blockstun, projectiles, special moves

This is a **non-commercial educational project** created to study fighting game mechanics and game engine design.

## 📌 Current Status / Known Gaps

The features below describe what's implemented; here's an honest snapshot of
what is and isn't playable at HEAD:

- ✅ **Akuma vs Akuma** is the playable matchup — both players are Akuma.
  `characters/ken.py` exists but is **experimental and not wired in** (no
  character select in the live game yet).
- ✅ **Parry is live**: tap forward (or down-forward for low) within the
  authentic 7-frame window to parry. Guard-direction nuances and red parry
  are still simplified.
- ⚠️ **Sprites are not bundled.** SF3 sprite art is Capcom's copyright and
  can't be redistributed; without local assets the game runs with placeholder
  rectangles. The sprite-extraction tooling in `tools/` is a personal-use path.
- ❌ **No charge motions, no negative edge** — deliberate omissions for now.
- ❌ No corner-pressure pushback on the attacker, no projectile-vs-projectile
  resolution yet.
- 🧭 See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for which module is canonical for each concern;
  superseded parallel implementations live in `attic/`.

## 🔬 Why Pydantic for Fighting Games?

Fighting games have **complex, interconnected data** that must be validated at runtime to prevent bugs. This project uses [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) for type-safe data validation throughout the engine.

### The Challenge

A single character in a fighting game has:
- **18+ normal attacks**, each with unique frame data (startup, active, recovery)
- **Multiple hitboxes per move** (attack hitboxes, body hurtboxes, hand hurtboxes)
- **Frame-accurate timing** - a single frame error breaks gameplay at 60 FPS
- **Hundreds of numeric values** - damage, stun, pushback, advantage frames, invincibility frames
- **Complex relationships** - total frames must equal startup + active + recovery
- **SF3 authenticity requirements** - parry window must be exactly 7 frames, damage scaling must match arcade values

### The Solution: Pydantic Schemas

**Before Pydantic** (error-prone):
```python
# Easy to make mistakes - no validation
akuma_punch = {
    "startup": 5,
    "active": 3,
    "recovery": 10,
    "total": 17  # BUG! Should be 18
}
```

**With Pydantic** (validated):
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, field_validator

class FrameData(BaseModel):
    startup: int
    active: int
    recovery: int
    total: int

    @field_validator('total')
    def validate_total(cls, v, info):
        expected = info.data['startup'] + info.data['active'] + info.data['recovery']
        if v != expected:
            raise ValueError(f"Total {v} must equal {expected}")
        return v

# This catches bugs immediately:
akuma_punch = FrameData(startup=5, active=3, recovery=10, total=17)
# ❌ ValidationError: Total 17 must equal 18
```

### Real Benefits

**1. Catch Bugs Early**
- Detects invalid frame data before it causes gameplay bugs
- Validates hitbox dimensions are positive numbers
- Ensures invincibility frames are within move duration

**2. SF3 Authenticity**
```python
@field_validator('parry')
def validate_parry_config(cls, v):
    if v.get('window_frames') != 7:  # SF3 authentic value
        raise ValueError("Parry window must be 7 frames")
    return v
```

**3. Type Safety**
- IDEs provide autocomplete for all character data
- Refactoring is safe - type errors caught immediately
- Self-documenting code with field descriptions

**4. YAML Integration**
```python
# Load character data from YAML with full validation
character = CharacterData.parse_file("akuma.yaml")
# All hitboxes, frame data, and moves validated on load!
```

### Project Examples

**Character Schemas** (`src/street_fighter_3rd/schemas/sf3_schemas.py`):
- `HitboxData` - Validates hitbox dimensions, damage values, hit properties
- `FrameData` - Validates frame timing with SF3 authenticity checks
- `MoveData` - Complete move definitions with nested validation
- `CharacterData` - Full character with 18+ normals, specials, and stats

**Key Features:**
- **Runtime validation** - Catches errors when loading YAML data
- **Nested schemas** - MoveData contains FrameData which contains HitboxData
- **Custom validators** - Enforces SF3 authentic values (parry window, damage scaling)
- **AI metadata** - Utility scores and risk levels for AI decision-making

This approach makes the engine **robust, maintainable, and faithful to SF3's frame-perfect gameplay**.
